# VLSI Engineer Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my **RTL + Physical Design Portfolio**.  
This repository documents my **24-week journey** to mastering both **RTL Design** and **Physical Design**.

## 📌 Contents
- RTL_Designs → Verilog & SystemVerilog codes + testbenches
- Physical_Design → Notes and reports on floorplanning, placement, CTS, routing
- Projects → RISC-V CPU, DSP Blocks, and more
- Resources → Study guides, textbooks, and cheat sheets

## 🛠 Skills Covered
- RTL Coding (Verilog, SystemVerilog)
- Simulation & Verification (Testbenches)
- Synthesis (Logic to Gates)
- Physical Design (Floorplanning → GDSII)
- Timing Closure, Power Planning

## 📖 Study Plan
Refer to the **RTL_PD_Study_Guide.pdf** in the `Resources/` folder for the 24-week roadmap with textbooks.

## 📂 Example Projects
- ✅ 2:1 MUX, Flip-Flop, ALU (Basics)
- ✅ FSM (Traffic Light Controller)
- 🚀 Mini RISC-V CPU (Capstone)
